This interactive application was developed as a part of the TRB 2017 Transportation Analytics Contest to analyze large sets of origin-destination data gleaned from wireless signaling (cell phone) data by AirSage. The application was developed using Shiny, a web application framework for the popular R package. Though this application was developed for the Orlando metropolitan region in Florida, USA, similar types of data can be analyzed using this tool. 

The application analyzes data by producing graphs that show hourly distribution, user class distribution and trip purpose distribution to/from each zone. It allows the user to select a zone by clicking on the map and choosing a day type to create the graphs.
